# Social Media API

## Description

This is an example of a backend API that would be used for displaying, adding to, changing, and deleting content on a social media site stored in a Mongo database. It is a very simple version of what one might find behind Facebook or Twitter.

I created this project to prove my knowledge of Mongo DB and Mongoose, as well as file structure and all the necessary connections.

It works by creating MongoDB models, and then using javascript routes and Mongoose to allow the end user to adjust the data using get post put and delete requests.
